- David Niyonshuti: Worked on Part 1: Probability distribution
 As I was working on my part of understanding normal probability distribution, I learned that when you have a continoues numerical data with missing values, you can use mean imputation to fill in the missing values, this helps in data preprocessing before you model your data. In addition, understanding normal distribution helps me to differ it with other probability distribution to know their use cases in their respective scenario depending on what decision you want to make depending on dataset you have.
