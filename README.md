### David Niyonshuti: Worked on Part 1: Probability distribution
 * As I was working on my part of understanding normal probability distribution, I learned that when you have a continoues numerical data with missing values, you can use mean imputation to fill in the missing values, this helps in data preprocessing before you model your data. In addition, understanding normal distribution helps me to differ it with other probability distribution to know their use cases in their respective scenario depending on what decision you want to make depending on dataset you have.

* Regarding the part I was working on, applying Bayesian probability to a real-world problem, I understood the concept very well. I compared it to the Monty Hall problem you showed us a few days ago, and I found that the Monty Hall problem is conditional probability. This type of probability is all about finding the chance of something happening because something else has already happened, while Bayesian probability is a way to update your beliefs about something when you get new information.
